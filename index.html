          around 260 million people across the globe as a native tongue, with
          another estimated 120 million people using Hindi as a second language
          in countries such as India and Nepal. Due to its vast number of
          speakers, Hindi is considered to be the fourth most-spoken language in
          the world, behind languages such as Chinese, Spanish, and English.

                  When you are in love you would very much wish to communicate
                  in your partner's language when the partner is a foreign
                  language speaker. You would wish to know about the partner's
                  culture, country, tradition etc. And language is the best
                  plausible way to go about it.

                  India has become one of the favorite destinations for
                  businesses to expand to in South East Asia. Learning Hindi
                  could give you an edge over your colleagues in your
                  professional sphere because of this. Also, you might impress
                  your Indian colleagues ;-)

                  Although India has a high population of English
                  speaking/understanding residents which wouldn't make it
                  exactly hard for you to navigate through the country, learning
                  the local language would give you an upper hand where you
                  wouldn't need to rely on anyone. While English will give you
                  complete access to the urban parts, knowledge of Hindi will
                  open up the streets for you. Discovering them will give you
                  richer experience of India.

                  Hindi is easy to learn as it has borrowed quite a few words
                  from English like 'bus', 'hospital', 'police' etc.. In the
                  same way, English has also borrowed some words like 'Bungalow'
                  or 'Jungle' from Hindi. Basic English words are understood by
                  most people as well. Due to this, you already have a
                  vocabulary base before you even start to learn Hindi. All you
                  need to pick up is basic Hindi and keep integrating English
                  words on the way!
